# Architecture for Local AI with Feedback Learning and Web Access

## Overview of the System

This project aims to build an AI assistant that runs locally (on PC or mobile) and answers any question by searching the web and generating original responses, including code. The system combines a large language model (LLM), a retrieval component, and a training/feedback loop. All data stays on the device, preserving privacy and avoiding subscription fees.

### Core Components
- **Pre-trained LLM:** Open-source language model (e.g., Meta LLaMA, Google Gemma) for text/code generation.
- **Retrieval Engine:** Queries the Internet (or local index) for up-to-date facts, augmenting the LLM with fresh info.
- **Interaction Interface:** Simple UI or command-line loop for user input and output.
- **Training/Feedback Pipeline:** Fine-tunes the model using curated examples and user feedback (good/bad answers). Logged conversations and feedback improve the model via supervised fine-tuning or RL with human feedback.

### System Flow
User → [Retrieve Documents] → [LLM Generates Answer] → User Rates → System Logs Result

## Running a Local LLM
Modern LLMs (e.g., GPT4All) can run on consumer hardware. Example using GPT4All Python SDK:
```python
pip install gpt4all
from gpt4all import GPT4All
model = GPT4All("Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct.Q4_0.gguf")
with model.chat_session():
    print(model.generate("Write a Python function to sort a list of numbers", max_tokens=256))
```
No cloud needed; inference runs locally. Choose a model (4–13B parameters) that fits your machine. Use libraries like Hugging Face Transformers or llama.cpp for efficient inference. Quantization (float16, Q4_0) reduces memory usage.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
To answer general questions, the AI uses RAG:
1. Receive user query.
2. Search the Web (DuckDuckGo, Google API, or open dataset).
3. Fetch and preprocess results (extract text, trim to fit context).
4. Combine with query (format prompt with search snippets).
5. Generate answer with LLM.

Libraries like LangChain or LlamaIndex can help integrate search APIs and LLM calls. The retriever supplies text but does not train the model; the LLM is simply "primed" with retrieved content.

## Training with Feedback
User marks each response as good or bad. Log these verdicts:
- **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT):** Collect good answers, use as (question, ideal_answer) pairs to further train the model.
- **RLHF:** Use ratings as reward signals. Train a reward model on ranked outputs, then fine-tune the LLM to maximize reward.

Start by storing good answers in one folder and bad answers in another. Periodically train on the "good" set using Hugging Face’s trl or built-in trainer. Over time, the AI learns from feedback.

## Logging and Monitoring
Log user inputs and AI outputs (with timestamps/context) for offline review. Store conversations in a text file or local database. Logs should capture: user query, retrieved context, AI answer, user rating.

## Architecture and Workflow
System workflow:
1. User Query
2. Search/Retrieve
3. LLM Prompt Construction
4. LM Response
5. User Rating (good/bad)
6. Store (query, response, rating)
7. Loop back to training

## Example Workflows

### User Workflow
- User enters a question/input.
- The question is recorded and saved.
- The AI generates a response, which is also saved.
- If the question contains unsafe or flagged content (e.g., requests for illegal or harmful actions), it is automatically flagged and moved to a separate area for review.
- The user receives a message: "Your question has been flagged. We cannot answer that question."
- For normal questions, the user receives the AI's response and can continue using the system.

### Developer (Training) Workflow
- Developers review saved questions and AI responses.
- Developers decide which responses are good or bad, marking them accordingly.
- Flagged questions are reviewed to confirm if they should remain flagged or be allowed.
- Developers use the curated good/bad responses to fine-tune the AI, improving its performance and safety.
- Periodically, the model is retrained on the updated dataset to get smarter and more aligned with developer standards.

### Security and Moderation
- The system automatically detects and flags unsafe, illegal, or harmful questions (e.g., "How do I make a bomb?").
- Flagged questions are not answered and are sent to a separate review area for developers.
- The AI informs the user when their question is flagged, maintaining transparency and safety.

### Summary
There are two sides to the system:
- **User Side:** Users interact with the AI, ask questions, and receive responses. Their questions and AI answers are saved for review.
- **Developer Side:** Developers review interactions, decide good/bad responses, handle flagged content, and train the AI to improve its intelligence and safety.

This separation ensures users have a safe experience, while developers maintain control over the AI's learning and behavior.

## Summary
Start with a pretrained LLM (e.g., GGUF-format LLaMA or Mistral via GPT4All). Integrate a search engine (RAG) for fresh answers. Implement an interface and logging system. Use logs for fine-tuning via supervised learning or RLHF. Each system component corresponds to a box in the flowchart (Input → Retrieval → LLM → Output → Feedback).
