# Workflow for Local AI Assistant Development (From Scratch)

This document provides a step-by-step workflow for building, deploying, and maintaining a local AI assistant, starting from an empty folder. Each step includes specific file creation and setup instructions.

---


## Step 1: Project Initialization
- **1.1 Create Project Folder:**
  - Make a new folder for your AI assistant (e.g., `ai-v.1.0`).
- **1.2 Create Backend Folder:**
  - Create a separate folder named `backend/` for backend code and services.
- **1.3 Backend Security & Setup:**
  - From the start, set up the backend folder for secure hosting on Google Cloud (use environment variables, HTTPS, and secure storage for secrets).
- **1.4 Create README Files:**
  - Add `README.md` for project overview and `README_WORKFLOW.md` for workflow steps in both `ai-v.1.0/` and `backend/` folders.
- **1.5 Create .gitignore Files:**
  - Add a `.gitignore` file in both `ai-v.1.0/` and `backend/` to exclude sensitive files and unnecessary artifacts from version control.
- **1.6 Create Requirements File:**
  - Add `requirements.txt` to list Python dependencies for both frontend and backend as needed.

## Step 2: Basic File Structure
- **2.1 Main Script:**
  - Create `main.py` as the entry point for your AI assistant.
- **2.2 Core Logic Folder:**
  - Create a folder `ai_core/` for core AI logic and modules.
- **2.3 Data Folders:**
  - Create a folder `conversations/` to store paired user input and AI response together (e.g., as JSON or text files).
  - Create folders `flagged_questions/`, `good_responses/`, and `bad_responses/` to store flagged and feedback data.

---


## Step 3: User Interaction & Data Collection
- **3.1 Build User Interface:**
  - Start with a simple command-line interface in `main.py`.
- **3.2 Record Conversation:**
  - Save each user question and its corresponding AI response together in a single file (e.g., JSON or text) in the `conversations/` folder.


---

## Step 4: Security & Moderation
- **4.1 Implement Flagging:**
  - Add code in `ai_core/` to scan user input for unsafe, illegal, or harmful content.
- **4.2 Handle Flagged Content:**
  - Move flagged questions to `flagged_questions/` and notify the user: "Your question has been flagged. We cannot answer that question."

---


## Step 5: Developer Review & Feedback
- **5.1 Protected Developer Moderation Page:**
  - Create a web page at `/devresponse` for developer-only access.
  - Require email entry; check against a protected file of allowed emails.
  - If the email matches, send an 8-digit random code to that email for verification.
  - Only allow access if the correct code is entered.
- **5.2 Review Conversations:**
  - On the dev page, display each conversation (user input and AI response) from the `conversations/` folder.
- **5.3 Mark Responses:**
  - Provide three buttons for each conversation:
    - Good Response (moves to `good_responses/`)
    - Bad Response (moves to `bad_responses/`)
    - Flagged Question (adds to `flagged_questions/` and future similar questions are auto-flagged)
- **5.4 Flagged Question Handling:**
  - Flagged questions will trigger the AI to respond: “We cannot answer this question, Your question has been flagged.”

---

## Step 6: Training & Model Improvement
- **6.1 Curate Training Data:**
  - Collect good Q&A pairs from `good_responses/`.
- **6.2 Fine-Tune Model:**
  - Use training scripts in `ai_core/` to fine-tune the AI (Supervised Fine-Tuning or RLHF).
- **6.3 Update Model:**
  - Replace or update the model files in your project.

---

## Step 7: Logging & Monitoring
- **7.1 Log All Interactions:**
  - Implement logging in `main.py` or `ai_core/` to record all user inputs, AI outputs, ratings, and flags with timestamps.
- **7.2 Monitor Performance:**
  - Regularly review logs and feedback folders to monitor AI quality and safety.

---

## Step 8: Deployment & Maintenance
- **8.1 Local Deployment:**
  - Package the project as a Python executable or app for PC (see `requirements.txt`).
- **8.2 Web Deployment (Optional):**
  - Build a web interface (Flask, FastAPI, or similar) and host securely.
- **8.3 Maintenance:**
  - Update model, code, and security filters based on new feedback and flagged content.

This workflow ensures you can build your AI assistant from an empty folder, with clear steps for file creation, setup, user interaction, security, developer feedback, training, and deployment.
