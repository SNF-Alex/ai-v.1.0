# Original Locally Trainable AI (Python)

This project aims to create a fully original AI system in Python that you can download, run locally on any device, and train yourself. The AI will learn from your feedback, distinguishing good and bad responses, and will be able to interact naturally via text or speech. No third-party AI services—100% original code.

## Main Concepts & Flow

1. **Blank AI Foundation**
	- The AI starts with no pre-trained knowledge or external models.
	- All logic and learning are coded from scratch in Python.

2. **Local Training System**
	- You train the AI by providing examples of good and bad responses.
	- Two folders/files: `good_responses/` and `bad_responses/` for storing feedback.
	- The AI uses these examples to learn and improve its answers.

3. **Natural Interaction**
	- Communicate with the AI by typing or speaking (person-to-person style).
	- The AI analyzes your input, searches for information online if needed, and generates a response.

4. **Self-Improvement Loop**
	- After each response, you can mark it as good or bad.
	- The AI updates its knowledge base and adapts future answers accordingly.

5. **Internet Search Capability**
	- The AI can search the web for information to help answer questions, similar to how an assistant looks up sources.

6. **Local-Only, Downloadable**
	- All code and data run locally—no cloud or external AI APIs.
	- Download the project from GitHub, install dependencies, and run on any device.

## Project Structure (Example)

- `main.py` — Main entry point for the AI.
- `ai_core/` — Core logic for understanding, learning, and responding.
- `good_responses/` — Folder for storing examples of good answers.
- `bad_responses/` — Folder for storing examples of bad answers.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
	```bash
	git clone <repo-url>
	cd ai-v.1.0
	```
2. Install dependencies:
	```bash
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```
3. Run the AI:
	```bash
	python main.py
	```
4. Interact and train:
	- Type or speak to the AI.
	- Mark responses as good or bad to help it learn.

## Extra Ideas / Addon Features

- **Speech Recognition & Synthesis**: Talk to the AI and have it talk back using Python libraries (e.g., `speech_recognition`, `pyttsx3`).
- **UI/UX Functionality**: Add a simple graphical interface (Tkinter, PyQt, or web-based) for easier interaction.
- **Conversation History**: Save and review past interactions.
- **Customizable Personality**: Adjust how the AI responds (friendly, formal, humorous, etc.).
- **Plugin System**: Allow users to add new skills or modules.
- **Multi-Device Support**: Make it easy to run on Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **Offline Knowledge Base**: Optionally allow the AI to work without internet access.

## Vision

The main goal is to build an original, locally running AI that you control and train yourself. You decide what is a good or bad response, and the AI adapts to your preferences and needs. All code is open and modifiable—no third-party AI, no cloud dependencies.
